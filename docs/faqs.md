## Can I increase the size of my bag or gathering bag?

Nope. You can increase the size of your personal bank and your shared bank.

## How can I transfer items to my other characters?

There is a shared bank in Newhaven City that you can use to transfer items between characters. You can pay to increase its size.

## Can I switch my Class or Profession or Specialization?

You can switch your Profession or Specialization, but you cannot change your Class without remaking your entire character.

If you change your Profession, you have to start over at level 1.

If you change your Specialization, you will keep your Class level but your Specialization will reset down to level 6. There is an xp bonus to help you get your Specialization level back up to your Class level.

If you change back again, you will be at level 6 again. You will lose any of your post-30 dropped skills if you abandon your Specialization.

To forget your Profession or Specialization, open the skills page, go to the correct tab, and right click the large icon in the top left corner. Then you can go to a trainer and get a new Specialization or Profession.

## Is there a compass in the game? How do I navigate?

There is no compass. There is a large blue planet in the sky named the Eye of Ibax, or Blupiter if you prefer. The Eye is always in the north, so you can use it to navigate. It is sometimes obscured by clouds or trees or mountains, so you will also want to learn landmarks to help get around.

## What happens when my health goes down to zero?

If you take enough damage to have zero health you will become unconscious. You will remain unconscious for three minutes unless you are revived by another player. Supporters and Wardens can use heals to revive you, but others must use smelling salts.

If you are not revived when the timer runs out, or if you press the respawn button, you will return to the nearest Hallows that you have visited.

After being revived you will lose 5% of your maximum health. If you respawn, you will lose 15% of your maximum health.

If you are revived, you will be disoriented for several seconds.

## Why are my maximum health and stamina reduced?

Over time using abilities, your maximum stamina will be reduced by a larger and larger percentage. This is a sign of fatigue.

If you die, your maximum health will be reduced.

You can recover both to their full maximum by sitting near an ember fire.

## Why is my armor class reduced? Why can't I use my gathering tools any more?

Items have durability. Using your gathering tools reduces their durability and when they reach zero, you can no longer use them.

Armor and weapons also have durability and your armor will be less effective as you take damage. This is a particular concern for tanks who constantly take a lot of damage in groups. As armor durability goes down, so does their contribution to your armor class.

You can repair your armor, weapons, and tools by visiting an outpost and using an Anvil. You must pay money to repair your items.
